  <h2><b>Low and Slow</b></h2>
  <dfn>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food <i>(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)</i> into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, <q>Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></dfn>
    
  <p>Next month, we will be serving <em>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</em><br>To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
